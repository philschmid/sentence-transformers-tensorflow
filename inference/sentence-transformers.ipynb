    "Thats it. We have now successfully created a custom TensorFlow model that can load a Sentence Transformer model and run inference on it to create document embeddings. This will allow you to integrate Sentence Transformers into your existing and new TensorFlow projects and workflows. We validated that our model creates embeddings that are similar to the original Sentence Transformers model.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as bonus we looked into how to integrate the tokenization into our model graph as well and created an `E2ESentenceTransformer` model that includes the tokenizer for BERT models, which are achieving state-of-the-art performance on similar tasks.\n",
